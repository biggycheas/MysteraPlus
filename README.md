## Installation

Because this isn't on the chrome web store, you'll need to install it manually. First, download the zip by clicking "Clone or download" and then "Download ZIP" and extract it somewhere. Then open the settings menu in chrome and open the extensions tab. Click the check box to enable developer mode, then click "Load unpacked extension" and select the folder you extracted to. You'll need to reload the game for it to work properly.

## Updating

To update your installation to a newer version delete the old installation directory, then download the zip and extract it to the same location. Open the settings menu in chrome and find the extension in the extensions tab and click "Reload." Then reload the game.
